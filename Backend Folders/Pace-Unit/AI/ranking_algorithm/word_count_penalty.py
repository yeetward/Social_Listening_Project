# AI/ranking_algorithm/word_count_penalty.py
"""
Word count penalty to reduce ranking of very short, low-quality posts.

Problem: Short posts like "I have iPhone 16" get ranked too high because
they contain exact keyword matches but lack substantial content.

Solution: Apply a smooth penalty to posts based on word count:
- Very short posts (< 50 words): Heavy penalty
- Medium posts (50-100 words): Gradual reduction in penalty
- Long posts (> 100 words): No penalty
